I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I am currently the motion planning lead of the [Cavalier Autonomous Racing](https://autonomousracing.dev/) team led by [Dr. Madhur Behl](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/madhur-behl). I also work with [Dr. Rohan Chandra](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/rohan-chandra) in the [Chandra Robot Autonomy Lab](https://cral-uva.github.io/) on planning and controls systems for safe and agile robots in constrained, social environments.

I previously worked at [Zipline](https://www.flyzipline.com/) as a Flight Autonomy Intern and at [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) as a Starship Software Intern.
